# EagleCAD Updater
This project was born out of frustration with Autodesk's current update system for EAGLE. Every new version requires a separate update
and install, which, as some suggest, makes sense in a professiona settings.

This tool is intended for use by hobbyists and professionals who want to keep up with new features and bugfixes in EAGLE but are fed up
with having to go through this process easily.

**This project is in development. No ETA is known as of yet.** You are welcome to add suggestions for how the software should function.
